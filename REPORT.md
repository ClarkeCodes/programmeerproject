## Description

Subject, intended audience, goal, etc.
Start with a short description of your application (like in the README.md, but very short, including a single screen shot).


## Technical Design
### Overview
My website has several components. When you open the website, you get to the introduction. This is the title, with a short introduction on the topic. To go to the data visualizations, you click the arrow to automatically scroll down, or you can just scroll down yourself. When you do, the background image stays fixed.

The first visualization is a world map, showing depression and suicide rates around the world. You can switch which data is displayed on the world map by clicking the button of 'Depression' or 'Suicide' above the world map. When you hover over the map, it will show a tooltip with the name of the country, and both the depression and suicide rates there.

Clicking on a country will take you to the next screen with a line graph and bar chart. The line graph shows trends in depression rates from 1995 to 2015. The bar charts shows the demographics

The line of the country you've clicked will be highlighted in the line graph, and the bar chart will show the dem

### Implementation

Clearly describe the technical design: how is the functionality implemented in your code? This should be like your DESIGN.md but updated to reflect the final application. First, give a high level overview, which helps us navigate and understand the total of your code (which components are there?). Second, go into detail, and describe the modules/classes and how they relate.

## Challenges
Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document (from the PROCESS.md). Here, we can see how much you have learned in the past month.

- Had to change my entire idea because the data wasn't available
- Went from The Netherlands to the entire world
- Had more data/ideas for visualizations but not enough time
- Demographics buttons
- Line graph with the buttons not working

## Decisions
Defend your decisions by writing an argument of a most a single paragraph. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs for your current solution? In an ideal world, given much more time, would you choose another solution?
I think my website is better as a whole because


Make sure the document is complete and reflects the final state of the application. The document will be an important part of your grade.
