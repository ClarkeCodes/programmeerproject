# day 2  

Today I decided to change the focus of my story slightly. Instead of immediately showing a map of The Netherlands, I start out with a world map. This is to provide context to the problem of depression worldwide and to be able to see how depression rates in The Netherlands measure up to the rest of the world.

I have made new sketches for visualize this idea, which includes the new world map at the top of the page. I also updated my README to inlude this new changes.
