[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/ElineJ/programmeerproject)](https://bettercodehub.com)

## Description

Every [40 seconds](http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/en/) someone dies of suicide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is something that will affect one out of five people during their lifetime.

Worldwide rates of depression have increased over the past ten years. My website looks at the depression and suicide rates around the world. It gives an overview of which countries have the highest rates of depression and suicide, what the trend of depression rates have been in each country and what the demographics of these depression rates.

The website aims to create more awareness of depression and suicide, by allowing users to explore depression and rates around the world through different visualizations.
