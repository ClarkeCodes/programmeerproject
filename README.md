# Depression and Suicide Around the World

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/ElineJ/programmeerproject)](https://bettercodehub.com)

## Description

Every 40 seconds someone dies of suicide. According to the World Health Organization, depression will affect 1 out of 5 people during their lifetime. On my website, you can find out what countries have the highest rates of depression and suicide, how depression rates have changed over the past ten years, and which groups are most at risk.

The goal of this project is to create more awareness of depression and suicide, by allowing users to explore data and information on the subject through different visualizations.
