# Overview

Map the separate parts of the solution onto the framework(s) that you are using. What APIs, methods or techniques do you need to implement each feature? Think about and fully express how the user interface will be handled, where the data is coming from, and how the various parts will work together to form a complete application.


## Sketches 

## Plugins to use:

For the map I will use *D3 datamaps*. I will use an SVG world map for the first visualization, and for the second visualization I will use an SVG map that shows each of the different boroughs in The Netherlands.  

To add a tooltip to the bar chart I will use *D3 tooltip*.

Some example visualizations I have found for inspiration:
- [Donut chart](http://bl.ocks.org/jdutta/9458987)
- [Pie and bar chart comparison](http://bl.ocks.org/nitaku/6c9d44be408e541fd654)
