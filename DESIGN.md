# Overview
____
Map the separate parts of the solution onto the framework(s) that you are using. What APIs, methods or techniques do you need to implement each feature? Think about and fully express how the user interface will be handled, where the data is coming from, and how the various parts will work together to form a complete application.

## Details

Some parts that you may describe here:

- a diagram of modules or classes that youâ€™ve decided to implement, in appropriate detail
- advanced sketches of your UI that clearly explain which features are connected to which underlying part of the code   

**Plugins to use:**

For the map I will use *D3 datamaps*. I will use an SVG world map for the first visualization, and for the second visualization I will use an SVG map that shows each of the different boroughs in The Netherlands.  

To add a tooltip to the bar chart I will use *D3 tooltip*.

Some example visualizations I have found for inspiration:
- [Donut chart](http://bl.ocks.org/jdutta/9458987)
- [Pie and bar chart comparison](http://bl.ocks.org/nitaku/6c9d44be408e541fd654)

**Data sources if you will get data from an external sources**

Deze data, daarvan, zet ik zo om, interacties, als je hierop klikt dan gebeurt er dit


- If your application has multiple independent programs working together (e.g. a separate script to clean your dataset) you need to provide a high-level overview of these components and then provide a lower-level overview of the inner workings of each component.
